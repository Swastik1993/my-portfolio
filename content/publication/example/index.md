abstract: In this paper we have proposed a new entropy based fuzzy clustering
  algorithm for segmentation of volumetric noisy brain MR image data. The
  algorithm utilizes intensity distribution from spatial cubic local
  neighborhood characterizing a possibility measure that defines likeliness of a
  voxel under consideration to belong into a cluster or region. This is realized
  by judiciously defining a Gaussian density function. We then normalized these
  likeliness measures to use them as an alternative membership function. In
  addition to the fuzzy membership function, this normalized likeliness measure
  is also incorporated into the objective function using a regularizing
  parameter that resolves the trade-off between these two terms. Finally, a
  fuzzy entropy defined by Shannon's function using the normalized likeliness
  measures is introduced that defines the vagueness and ambiguity uncertainty
  while classifying a voxel into its possible cluster. Therefore, the cluster
  prototypes of the proposed algorithm utilize the fuzzy membership functions,
  likeliness measures and fuzzy entropy. To validate the algorithm, we have
  performed both qualitative and quantitative analysis on noisy simulated and
  clinical brain MR image volumes. Its results are found to be superior while
  comparing with some of the state-of-the-art algorithms.
