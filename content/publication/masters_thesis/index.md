abstract: In this dissertation entitled “Volumetric Brain MR Image Segmentation using Entropy based Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm” an image segmentation method has been proposed that is based on fuzzy c-means algorithm and has been modified by using Shannon entropy to improve the robustness to the noise and intensity inhomogeneity that may be present in a brain MR image. A very detailed comparative analysis has made with different use cases also including a contrast with earlier methods.
