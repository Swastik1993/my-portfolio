Hi! I am an enthusiastic, self-motivated and a results-oriented Data/ML engineer with 2+ years of experience in image processing, NLP, data mining and model deployment.

Research projects in the fields of image processing and natural language understanding is something that is always exciting to me.
Personally, I have experience working in quite a few NLP, NLU, Image Processing and Computer Vision projects.
In the field of machine learning I have mostly worked on deep learning algorithms such as DBN, CNN, RNN, Mask RCNN, LSTM and Soft Computing principles of Probabilistic Models and Fuzzy Logics.

I believe in the ikigai philosophy and am always eager to solve a challenging problem or to analyze anomalous data behavior.

__I am still in the process of building/updating my site. Why don't you visit me again after a few days and I hope to have completed it by then.__ Thanks for visiting! ðŸ˜„
